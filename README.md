There are many great applications available on GitHub, however, this can be counted as one them. We wanted to make an app that would connect VESIT students and teachers, therefore we used flutter and firebase to do it, which is hell of a task.

Here's why:
* We needed hands on practice on dart.
* We wanted to get an idea of creating open-source projects.
* We wanted to explore about the Firebase and online streaming content. :smile:



A list of commonly used resources that I find helpful are listed in the acknowledgements.

### Built With

I am only listing the main things which are needed for this rest you can see inside the requirements.txt

* [Dart](https://dart.dev/guides)
* [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/)
* [Firebase](https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

First of all you will need a database of your own which should be created in firebase , we created out database with cloud-firestore you can use whichever database you want, we recommend Firestore.
This the Database structure.
```

[
  user : [
    {
      "id" : (String),
      "designation" :  (String),
      "displayName" : (String),
      "email" : (String),
      "photoUrl" : (String [ Url of the image ]),
     }
  ],
  student : [
    {
      "batch" : (String),
      "branch" : (String),
      "phoneNumber" : (String),
      "year" : (String),
    } 
  ],
  posts : [
    comments : [
      {
        "id" : (String),
        "comment" : (String),
        "created" : (Timestamp),
        "designation" : (String),
        "displayName" : (String),
        "photoUrl" : (String [ Url of the image ]),
      }
    ]
  ],
  ChatRoom : [
    {
      "id" : (String),
      "userName" : (String),
      "chatroomId" : (String),
      "email" : (String),
      "photoUrl" : (String [ Url of the image ]),
      "time" : (Number),
      "userInfo" : [
        {
          "id" : (String),
          "designation" :  (String),
          "displayName" : (String),
          "email" : (String),
          "photoUrl" : (String [ Url of the image ]),
        },
       ],
       "chats" : [
          {
            "message" : (String),
            "messagedBy" : (String),
            "messagetime" : (Number),
            "time" : (Timestamp),
          }
       ]
    } 
  ]
]


```
After this add Data to your database and then integrate your database with by service_key.json generated by Firebase.

Post this you need to run the following command in the same directory in the Terminal or command prompt.
```dart
flutter pub get
```
If you have made it so far then you are genius enough to make your own application.
Now run 
```dart
flutter run
```
and ka-boom!! :clap:
